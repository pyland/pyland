"""
This is a program. You will be using these to do most of the game.

The point of this game is to show you how powerful programming is in
solving problems that seem impossible, or just really difficult,
without it.

Here are some quick tips:

• Run this script with "r"

• Halt (stop running) with "h"

"""

# That thing at the top is a "string".
# In other words it's just a piece of text. A piece of
# text doesn't do much, so it's OK to just leave it there.
#
# This, on the other hand, is a comment.
# Not only does a comment not do anything... it isn't even anything.
# This means you can use it in more places than just a string.


# Here's the interesting part:
for _ in range(5000):
	move(east)

# This means:
#
#     repeat 10 times:
#         * move to the east
#
# If you run it (press "r"), you'll see that you move,
# really fast, 10 places east.
#
# Don't worry if this doesn't mean much yet. You'll get
# better really quickly.
